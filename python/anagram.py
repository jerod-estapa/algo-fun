# Anagram Check Algorithm Solution

# Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written
# using the exact same letters (so you can just rearrange the letters to get a different phrase or word).


def anagram(s1, s2):
    a1 = [s1].split
    a2 = [s2].split
